# Overview

{This data set is a weather prediction data set based on weather patterns in Seattle Washing from 2012 to 2015. It shows the date, the amount of precipitation, the max and min temperatures, the wind speed, and what the weather was. This data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction. }

{I wanted to gain expereince using the Pandas library in python. I found this data set and I wanted to know more about it so I knew it was the perfect data set to learn with. I wanted to learn more about the weather patterns so I chose three questions I had and found the answer by using pandas to anaylze it further.}

# Data Analysis Results

{   
    1. What three month period has the most precipitation?
        The three month period with the most precipitation is October - December 2015 with an average of 6.733.  
    2. What is the longest period of time that it goes without raining?
        The longest time it went without raining or another kind of precipitation was 18 days. This took place 12-08-22 to 12-09-08.
    3. What is the average of max and min temperature does it rain the most?
        The average max temperature it rains at is 13.45 degrees celsius while the average mininum temperature is 7.58.

# Development Environment

{I used Visual Studio Code, Git Hub, and Jupyter notebook to write my code.}

{Python was the language that was used for this project. Libraries used were pandas and matplotlib.}

# Future Work

* I could improve the efficiency of question one by using a loop to check every three month period instead of the ones that I chose that looked like they had the most precipitation. 
* Answer other questions such as what month was the rainiest each year, and was the wind speed higher on days with one type of weather compared to other weather types. 
* Add more graphs to accuratly display the information that I found.
